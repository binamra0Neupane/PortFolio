    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Binamra Neupane â€” a sophomore at the University of Texas at Arlington, majoring in Software Engineering.
      Iâ€™m an aspiring software engineer with a passion for building cool, meaningful stuff. Lately, Iâ€™ve been diving into video editing and content creationâ€”skills Iâ€™m excited to grow as I start putting my own content out into the world.
      Always learning, always experimenting.</p>

      <h3>Checkers</h3>
      <p>CSE 3310: Fundamentals of Software Engineering</p>
      <p>As part of a semester-long group project in my Fundamentals of Software Engineering course (CSE 3310), I collaborated with a team of 60 students divided into 12 groups of five. Our collective goal was to develop a fully functional digital version of the classic game Checkers, emphasizing modular design and real-world software engineering practices.</p>
      <p>I was a member of the Login/New Account team, responsible for implementing user authentication features. This included account creation, secure login functionality, and session management. We worked closely with other teams to ensure seamless integration and a cohesive user experience across the platform.</p>
      <p>This project enhanced my understanding of team collaboration, modular development, and applying core software engineering principles in a structured environment.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <h3>NP-complete Problem</h3>
    <p>
  As an Honors student in my Data Structures and Algorithms course,
   I was given the opportunity to conduct independent research on computational complexity. 
   I chose to explore NP-Complete problems and focused on a custom variant called the <strong>Magnets Problem</strong>, 
   which involves determining whether a given set of symbols (like lettered magnets) 
   can be fully used to form valid words from a predefined vocabulary. 
   I formally proved that the problem is <strong>NP-Complete</strong> via a reduction from the <em>3-Dimensional Matching</em> problem. 
   This work was documented in an IEEE-formatted research paper, which includes a detailed proof, background on NP-Completeness, 
   and a discussion on adapting approximation algorithms from the Vertex Cover problem to similar challenges. 
   This experience strengthened my understanding of computational theory and research writing.
